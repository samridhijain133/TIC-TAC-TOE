# TIC-TAC-TOE
You all have played tic-tac-toe game when you were a kid. I have tried making such a game with the help of python. It was the first project I made so its kind of basic. Check it out!! 
Also, the code uses a module named 'IPython' , so make sure you have it to run the game without any error.
